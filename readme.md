# Notes

- The state-space is a function of non-linear equations 
- It can be numerically solved using *Euler* integration
- Euler integration depends on an initial condition
- It is then stepped via time increments to obtain a `time-history` simulation 

- Kinematics = study of motion of objects w/o regard to the mechanicism that cause the motion
- motion of physical objects can be decribed by means of vectors in 3-directions
- and performing a kinematic analysis

- An inertia fram = a frame of refeence in which newtons laws apply

- Euclidean vector = exists only in three dimensional space and comes in two types
- 1) bound vector: a vector from a fixed point in a frame. eg. a position vector
- 2) free vector: a vector that can be translated parrell to itself. eg. velocity

- velocity & accel are relative to a frame of reference
